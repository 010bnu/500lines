Project: Flow Shop Scheduler
Requirements: Python

This directory holds a basic implementation of a flow shop
scheduler that parses a flow shop problem, solves it heuristically,
and then displays the resulting schedule. The flow shop scheduling
problem is a well-studied optimization problem, best described by
the wikipedia entry:

Flow shop scheduling problems, are a class of scheduling problems with a work shop or group shop in which the flow control shall enable an appropriate sequencing for each job and for processing on a set of machines or with other resources 1,2,...,m in compliance with given processing orders. Especially the maintaining of a continuous flow of processing tasks is desired with a minimum of idle time and a minimum of waiting time. Flow shop scheduling is a special case of job shop scheduling where there is strict order of all operations to be performed on all jobs. Flow shop scheduling may apply as well to production facilities as to computing designs.
