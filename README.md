Mission
-------

Every architect studies family homes,
apartments,
schools,
and other common types of buildings during her training.
Equally,
every programmer ought to know how a compiler turns text into instructions,
how a spreadsheet updates cells,
and how a browser decides what to put where when it renders a page.
This book's goal is to give readers that broad-ranging overview,
and while doing so,
to help them understand how software designers think.

Contributions should not focus on the details of one algorithm
or on the features of a particular language.
Instead,
they should discuss the decisions and tradeoffs software architects make when crafting an application:

*   Why divide the application into these particular modules with these particular interfaces?
*   Why use inheritance here and composition there?
*   Why multi-thread this but not that?
*   When should the application allow for or rely on plugins,
    and how should they be configured and loaded?
