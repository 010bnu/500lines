Project: Cluster (a working title!)
Requirements: Python

This directory holds a simple implementation of a replicated state machine
that can also feed clients information on cluster membership.

* aa_statemachine.py -- illustrates the state machine client API
* bb_network.py -- introduces a network of communicating processors
* cc_replicated.py -- a replicated state machine with consensus and a fixed membership
