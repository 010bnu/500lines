From Oct 5
----------

Diagrams:
 - node types and relationships between them
 - list of message types at "Message Types"
 - interaction diagrams for each bunch of message types

Detail:
 - example of no decision being made in simple paxos
 - examples of message type implementation (at "Using named tuples to
   describe each message")
 - component model would allow swapping in a "real" network class

Editing:
 - Transition at "Introducing Cluster"
 - "The application accesses the shared state through .." unclear
 - Tie in testing at "Component Model"
 - define "network partition"
 - Transition after components (Network/------)
 - at "Interactive debuggers", also hard to debug over multiple machines
