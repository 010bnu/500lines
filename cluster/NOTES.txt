----------

Detail:
 - example of no decision being made in simple paxos
   (need to review the literature)
 - component model would allow swapping in a "real" network class

Editing:
 - Transition at "Introducing Cluster"
 - "The application accesses the shared state through .." unclear
 - Transition after components (Network/------)
 - at "Interactive debuggers", also hard to debug over multiple machines
